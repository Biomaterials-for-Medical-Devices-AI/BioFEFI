# BioFEFI: Python Toolkit for Machine Learning, Feature Importance, and Fuzzy Interpretation

## Overview

BioFEFI is a no-code application for training and interpreting machine learning models. You can search hyper-parameters manually or ask BioFEFI to perform hyper-parameter search automatically. Also included is the ability to perform exploratory data analysis before you create any models. BioFEFI also produces publication-ready graphs along with model metrics and, of course, the models themselves!

**Note**: The data used in this pipeline needs to be pre-cleaned and pre-modeled. This includes:
- Data type formatting
- Missing values resolved
- Outliers removed
- Feature engineering completed

The data should be in a format where all columns except the last one are input features, and the last column is the target variable.

## Install and run BioFEFI

For information on how to install BioFEFI, check the [instructions](https://biomaterials-for-medical-devices-ai.github.io/BioFEFI/users/installation.html).

## Usage

BioFEFI will open in your internet browser when you run it. The main screen will appear giving a brief introduction to the app. To the left of the screen you will see a list of pages with the different functionalities of the app. Explanations can be found in the [instructions](https://biomaterials-for-medical-devices-ai.github.io/BioFEFI/index.html).
