# BioFEFI: Python Toolkit for Machine Learning, Feature Importance, and Fuzzy Interpretation

## Overview

This toolkit provides a streamlined workflow for machine learning model training, feature importance analysis, and fuzzy interpretation. It includes pipelines for data ingestion, model training, feature importance evaluation, and fuzzy logic rule generation.

**Note**: The data used in this pipeline needs to be pre-cleaned and pre-modeled. This includes:
- Data type formatting
- Missing values resolved
- Outliers removed
- Feature engineering completed

The data should be in a format where all columns except the last one are input features, and the last column is the target variable.
